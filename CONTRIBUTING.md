# Contributing to ngCorex

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **ngCorex**
All contributions are welcome - from bug reports to documentation fixes.

ngCorex is still in **early development**, so we value:

- Clear problem descriptions
- Small, focused changes
- Thoughtful discussion before large refactors

---

## How to Contribute

### Report Bugs

If you find a bug:

- Describe what you expected to happen
- Describe what actually happened
- Include minimal reproduction steps if possible

Please search existing issues before opening a new one.

### Suggest Features

Feature requests are welcome, especially if they:

- Improve developer experience
- Reduce confusion
- Align with design-token workflows

For larger ideas, open an issue first to discuss direction.

---

### Code Contributions

Before submitting a PR:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Keep changes focused and incremental
4. Ensure the project builds successfully
5. Add or update documentation if needed

ngCorex prioritizes:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Backward compatibility
- Beginner-friendly behavior

## Development Philosophy

- ngCorex is a **build-time tool**, not a runtime framework
- Breaking changes are avoided unless clearly justified
- Features are added deliberately, not reactively

If you're unsure about an approach, open an issue first - discussion is encouraged.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and kind.  
Harassment or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.
