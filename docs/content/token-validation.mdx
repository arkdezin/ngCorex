# Token Validation

ngCorex validates all design tokens before generating CSS.

Validation exists to prevent accidental design drift, catch mistakes early, and keep design systems consistent as projects grow.

It is designed to be predictable, low-noise, and actionable.

---

## When does validation run?

Validation runs automatically whenever you execute:

```bash
npx ngcorex build
```

or when running in watch mode.

Tokens are validated **before** any CSS is generated.
If validation fails, no output is produced.

---

## Validation levels

ngCorex uses a three-level validation system:

1. Errors
2. Warnings
3. Informational messages

Each level has a specific purpose.

---

## Errors (blocking)

Errors indicate invalid or unsupported token values.

When an error occurs:

- the build stops
- no CSS is generated
- the error must be fixed before continuing

Examples of errors:

- unsupported value formats
- invalid units
- incorrect data types
- structurally invalid token definitions

Errors exist to protect the integrity of the output.

---

## Warnings (non-blocking)

Warnings highlight potentially problematic or unusual patterns.

When a warning occurs:

- the build continues
- CSS is generated
- a message is displayed for awareness

Examples of warnings:

- inconsistent scales
- uncommon or risky patterns
- values that may cause unintended results

Warnings are meant to inform, not interrupt.

Common and industry-standard patterns do not emit warnings.

---

## Informational messages

Informational messages provide guidance and context.

When an info message occurs:

- the build continues
- no action is required
- the message can be safely ignored

Examples:

- optional scale completeness suggestions
- best-practice guidance
- explanatory notes about token structure

Info messages exist to help users learn the system over time.

---

## Actionable diagnostics

All validation messages include:

- the exact token path involved
- a clear description of the issue
- guidance on how to resolve or improve it

This allows issues to be fixed quickly without guessing.

---

## Deterministic behavior

Validation in ngCorex is deterministic.

This means:

- the same tokens always produce the same messages
- message order does not change between runs
- builds are predictable and repeatable

Determinism is critical for CI environments and team workflows.

---

## Stability guarantees

Validation rules are designed to be stable.

- Valid configurations remain valid across minor releases
- New rules do not break existing valid tokens
- CSS output remains backward compatible

This allows teams to upgrade ngCorex with confidence.

---

## Why validation is strict

ngCorex intentionally prioritizes correctness over flexibility.

Allowing arbitrary values everywhere makes it easy for design systems to drift silently.

Validation ensures:

- mistakes are caught early
- design intent stays centralized
- scaling across teams remains manageable

Strictness is a feature, not a limitation.

---

## Common questions

### “Why is this a warning and not an error?”

Warnings indicate patterns that may be acceptable but deserve attention.
Errors are reserved for cases where output correctness cannot be guaranteed.

### “Can I disable validation?”

No.

Validation is a core part of the engine and cannot be disabled.
This ensures consistent behavior across environments and teams.
