# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up ngCorex in a new or existing project.

You do not need prior knowledge of design tokens or CSS frameworks to get started.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing ngCorex, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed (v18 or newer recommended)
- npm available in your project
- A JavaScript or TypeScript project

ngCorex performs all work at build time and does not require any runtime dependencies.

---

## Installation

Install both the CLI and the CSS engine:

```bash
npm install -D @ngcorex/cli
```

The CLI is used to scaffold files and run builds.
The CSS package contains the token engine and CSS output logic.

---

## Initialize ngCorex

Run the init command:

```bash
npx ngcorex init
```

This command scaffolds a minimal, production-ready setup.

After running it, you will see new files in your project.

---

## Generated files

The init command creates the following files:

### `tokens.json`

This is the **primary file you will edit**.

It contains your design tokens:

- spacing
- colors
- typography
- radius
- zIndex
- shadows

All styling decisions originate from this file.

---

### `ngcorex.config.ts`

This file connects the engine together.

In most cases, you do not need to modify it.
It exists to:

- define token input sources
- configure output locations
- enable future extensibility

For most users, this file can be left untouched.

---

## Build your CSS

To generate CSS from your tokens, run:

```bash
npx ngcorex build
```

ngCorex will:

1. Read `tokens.json`
2. Normalize token values
3. Validate tokens
4. Generate CSS variables

If validation errors are found, the build will stop and display actionable messages.

Warnings and informational messages do not block the build.

---

## Watch mode

During development, you can enable watch mode:

```bash
npx ngcorex build --watch
```

The build will re-run automatically when `tokens.json` changes.

---

## Where is the output?

By default, ngCorex generates CSS variables into a compiled output file.

The exact output path can be found in `ngcorex.config.ts`.

You can import this generated CSS file into your application like any other stylesheet.

---

## What to edit (and what not to)

**You should edit:**

- `tokens.json`

**You usually should not edit:**

- `ngcorex.config.ts`
- generated CSS output files

This separation helps keep styling decisions centralized and predictable.

---

## Common first steps

After your first successful build, try:

- Adjusting spacing or color values in `tokens.json`
- Running the build again to see updated output
- Exploring additional token categories

ngCorex will guide you with clear validation messages as you experiment.
