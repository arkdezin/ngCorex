# Versioning and Stability

ngCorex follows semantic versioning and is designed to evolve without surprising its users.

This document explains what you can expect when upgrading and which parts of the system are considered stable.

---

## Semantic versioning

ngCorex uses the following versioning scheme:

```text
MAJOR.
MINOR.
PATCH.
```

- **MAJOR** - breaking changes
- **MINOR** - new features without breaking existing valid configurations
- **PATCH** - bug fixes and internal improvements

Even while the major version is `0`, ngCorex treats stability seriously.

---

## What is considered stable

The following behaviors are considered stable across minor releases:

- Valid token structures remain valid
- CSS output remains backward compatible
- Deterministic validation behavior
- CLI command names and core flags

If a configuration works in one minor version, it is expected to work in the next.

---

## Validation stability

Validation rules are designed to evolve carefully.

- New validation rules do not break existing valid tokens
- Industry-standard patterns are treated as safe
- Optional checks are surfaced as informational messages

This ensures that upgrades improve safety without introducing friction.

---

## Changes in minor releases

Minor releases may include:

- New token categories
- Additional validation rules
- Improved diagnostics and messaging
- DX improvements in the CLI

These changes are additive and do not require changes to existing valid setups.

---

## Breaking changes

Breaking changes are avoided whenever possible.

If a breaking change is necessary:

- it will be documented clearly
- it will only occur in a major version bump
- migration guidance will be provided

Breaking changes will never be introduced silently.

---

## Patch releases

Patch releases focus on correctness and stability.

They may include:

- bug fixes
- performance improvements
- internal refactors
- documentation updates

Patch releases do not change behavior for valid inputs.

---

## Stability milestones

Certain releases mark explicit stability improvements.

For example:

- v0.2.0 establishes stable validation behavior
- diagnostics are categorized and deterministic
- CSS output remains fully backward compatible

These milestones are documented in the changelog.

---

## Upgrading safely

To upgrade ngCorex safely:

1. Review the changelog
2. Upgrade dependencies
3. Run a build (or dry run)
4. Review any new diagnostics

Warnings and informational messages are intended to guide, not block.

---

## Long-term goals

ngCorex aims to provide:

- a stable core engine
- predictable upgrades
- clear migration paths
- confidence for long-lived projects

Stability is a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

---

## Next steps

- [**Engine Pipeline**](./engine-pipeline.mdx) - architectural guarantees
