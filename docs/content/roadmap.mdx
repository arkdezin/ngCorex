# Roadmap

This document outlines the general direction of ngCorex.

The roadmap is intentionally high-level. Priorities may evolve based on feedback, real-world usage, and stability considerations.

---

## Current focus

The current focus of ngCorex is to strengthen the core engine.

This includes:

- token normalization
- validation correctness and determinism
- stable CSS variable generation
- clear and predictable CLI behavior
- high-quality documentation

These foundations must be solid before expanding further.

---

## Near-term goals

In the near term, ngCorex aims to:

- refine existing validation rules
- improve diagnostic clarity and guidance
- expand documentation and examples
- harden edge cases discovered through usage
- ensure backward compatibility across minor releases

The priority is confidence and reliability, not rapid feature expansion.

---

## Medium-term direction

Once the core is stable, ngCorex may explore:

- additional output layers
- improved configuration ergonomics
- better integration patterns for modern frontend frameworks
- more advanced token relationships and constraints

These features will be additive and opt-in.

---

## Angular integration

ngCorex is designed to be Angular-native, but Angular integration is intentionally deferred.

Before introducing Angular-specific tooling:

- the core engine must be stable
- token workflows must be proven
- configuration and validation behavior must be predictable

Angular integration will build on the existing engine, not replace it.

---

## What is out of scope (for now)

To maintain focus, the following are explicitly out of scope in the short term:

- runtime styling systems
- component libraries
- opinionated design presets
- visual editors

ngCorex focuses on infrastructure, not UI.

---

## Feedback and direction

Feedback plays an important role in shaping the roadmap.

Useful feedback includes:

- real-world usage patterns
- pain points in token modeling
- validation edge cases
- DX improvements

The goal is to evolve ngCorex based on actual needs, not speculation.

---

## A note on change

ngCorex values stability over speed.

Features will be added carefully, with clear documentation and migration guidance where needed.

The roadmap represents intent, not obligation.
