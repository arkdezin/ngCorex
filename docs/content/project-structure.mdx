# Project Structure

This document explains the files and folders introduced by ngCorex and how they are intended to be used.

The goal is to make it clear **what you should edit**, **what you usually should not edit**, and **why each file exists**.

---

## Overview

After running:

```bash
npx ngcorex init
```

your project will typically include the following files:

```txt
tokens.json
ngcorex.config.ts
```

Additional files may be generated during the build process.

---

## tokens.json

This is the **most important file** in an ngCorex setup.

All design decisions originate from this file.

### What belongs here

`tokens.json` contains design tokens such as:

- spacing values
- color palettes
- typography scales
- border radius values
- z-index layers
- shadow definitions

These values define the visual language of your project.

### How it is used

During a build, ngCorex:

1. reads `tokens.json`
2. normalizes token values
3. validates them against constraints
4. uses them to generate CSS variables

### How often should you edit it?

Frequently.

Most day-to-day changes in an ngCorex-based project involve adjusting values in `tokens.json`.

---

## ngcorex.config.ts

This file wires the engine together.

It tells ngCorex:

- where tokens are located
- where generated CSS should be written
- which output layers are enabled

### Do I need to edit this file?

In most cases, **no**.

The default configuration created by `ngcorex init` is designed to work without modification.

This file exists to support:

- advanced workflows
- future extensibility
- non-standard project layouts

If you are unsure whether you need to change something here, you probably do not.

---

## Generated output

When you run:

```bash
npx ngcorex build
```

ngCorex generates CSS output based on your tokens.

### Important notes

- Generated files should not be edited manually
- Changes will be overwritten on the next build
- Treat generated CSS as build artifacts

You should always update tokens, not output.

---

## Recommended mental model

A simple way to think about ngCorex is:

- **tokens.json** → _design decisions_
- **ngcorex.config.ts** → _engine wiring_
- **generated CSS** → _compiled output_

Each file has a single responsibility.

This separation helps keep styling consistent and predictable as projects grow.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Editing generated CSS files directly
- Duplicating design values outside of `tokens.json`
- Adding arbitrary values to bypass validation
- Treating ngCorex as a runtime styling tool

ngCorex is intentionally strict to prevent accidental drift.

## Next steps

Continue with:

- [**Design Tokens**](./design-tokens.mdx) – token categories and structure
- [**Token Validation**](./token-validation.mdx) – understanding errors, warnings, and info messages
- [**Engine Pipeline**](./engine-pipeline.mdx) – a deeper look at the build process
