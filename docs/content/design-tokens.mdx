# Design Tokens

Design tokens are the foundation of ngCorex.

Every spacing value, color, font size, or shadow used by your application is defined as a token. These tokens form a shared design vocabulary that ngCorex can validate, normalize, and compile into CSS.

---

## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are named values that represent design decisions.

Instead of using raw values like `8px`, `#2563eb`, or `1.25rem` directly in styles, you define them once and reference them consistently.

Examples:

- `spacing.sm` instead of `8px`
- `colors.primary.500` instead of `#2563eb`
- `fontSize.md` instead of `1rem`

This approach improves consistency, readability, and long-term maintainability.

---

## The `tokens.json` file

All design tokens are defined in a single file: `tokens.json`.

This file is:

- the primary interface for most users
- the single source of truth for design values
- validated automatically during builds

A minimal example:

```json
{
  "spacing": {
    "xs": "4px",
    "sm": "8px",
    "md": "16px"
  },
  "colors": {
    "primary": {
      "100": "#dbeafe",
      "500": "#3b82f6",
      "900": "#1e3a8a"
    }
  }
}
```

You are encouraged to expand this file as your design system grows.

## Supported token categories

ngCorex supports the following token categories.

Each category has its own validation rules and expected structure.

---

### Spacing

Defines spacing values used for margins, padding, gaps, and layout.

```json
{
  "spacing": {
    "xs": "4px",
    "sm": "8px",
    "md": "16px",
    "lg": "24px"
  }
}
```

Spacing values must use supported units and formats.

---

### Colors

Defines color palettes using nested objects.

```json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": {
      "100": "#dbeafe",
      "500": "#3b82f6",
      "900": "#1e3a8a"
    },
    "neutral": {
      "50": "#fafafa",
      "900": "#111827"
    }
  }
}
```

Color scales are validated for format, consistency, and common industry patterns.

---

### Radius

Defines border radius values.

```json
{
  "radius": {
    "sm": "2px",
    "md": "4px",
    "lg": "8px"
  }
}
```

---

### Z-Index

Defines layering values.

```json
{
  "zIndex": {
    "dropdown": 1000,
    "modal": 1100,
    "tooltip": 1200
  }
}
```

Z-index values are validated for type and format.

---

### Typography

Defines typography-related tokens.

```json
{
  "typography": {
    "fontSize": {
      "sm": "0.875rem",
      "md": "1rem",
      "lg": "1.25rem"
    },
    "fontWeight": {
      "regular": 400,
      "medium": 500,
      "bold": 700
    },
    "lineHeight": {
      "tight": "1.2",
      "normal": "1.5"
    }
  }
}
```

Each sub-category is validated independently.

---

### Shadows

Defines box shadow values.

```json
{
  "shadows": {
    "sm": "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)",
    "md": "0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"
  }
}
```

Shadow values are validated for structure and type.

---

## Naming and structure guidelines

ngCorex does not enforce naming conventions, but the following guidelines are recommended:

- Use descriptive, semantic names
- Avoid embedding raw values in names
- Keep scales consistent within a category

Good:

- `spacing.sm`, `spacing.md`
- `colors.primary.500`

Avoid:

- `spacing.8px`
- `colors.blueish`

---

## Validation and safety

All tokens are validated during the build process.

- Invalid values produce errors and block the build
- Suspicious patterns produce warnings
- Informational messages provide guidance without interruption

This ensures incorrect or inconsistent values are caught early.

Validation rules are designed to be deterministic: the same input will always produce the same results.

---

## Normalization (brief overview)

Before generating CSS, ngCorex normalizes token values into a consistent internal format.

Normalization:

- does not change the meaning of values
- ensures consistent output across categories
- enables predictable CSS variable generation

The details of this process are covered in the **Engine Pipeline** documentation.

---

## Recommended workflow

1. Define or update values in `tokens.json`
2. Run the build
3. Review validation messages if any
4. Import generated CSS into your application

Design decisions should always be made at the token level, not in generated output.
