# ngCorex

**ngCorex** is an **Angular-native utility CSS and design token engine**.

It is inspired by ideas from Tailwind, but it is **not a Tailwind clone**, **not a component library**, and **not React-focused**.

ngCorex is built for **Angular teams**, **design systems**, and **enterprise-scale governance**.

---

## What ngCorex Is

ngCorex focuses on:

* 🎨 **Design tokens** (spacing, colors, etc.)
* 🧭 **Constraints & governance** (rules that enforce consistency)
* ⚙️ **CLI tooling** (`ngcorex build`, watch mode, dry runs)
* 🅰️ **Angular-centric workflows**
* 🏢 **Enterprise readiness** (predictable, auditable CSS output)

ngCorex generates **CSS variables**, not components.

---

## What ngCorex Is NOT

ngCorex is **not**:

* ❌ a component library
* ❌ a Tailwind replacement
* ❌ React-oriented
* ❌ runtime-dependent in the browser

All work happens **at build time**.

## Repository Structure

```txt
ngcorex/
├─ packages/
│  ├─ css/        → Core engine (@ngcorex/css)
│  └─ cli/        → CLI tool   (@ngcorex/cli)
├─ ngcorex.config.ts   → User config (dev-only)
├─ package.json        → Root (private)
├─ tsconfig.base.json
├─ tsconfig.json
└─ .gitignore
```

### Important Notes

* `dist/` folders are **gitignored**
* Source code lives in `src/`
* Builds happen **before publishing**
* The repo is designed to be **clean and publishable**

---

## Packages

### `@ngcorex/css`

Core engine package.

Responsibilities:

* Design token definitions
* Token normalization
* Constraint validation
* CSS variable generation
* Optional CSS `@layer` output

Exports:

```ts
buildCssFromConfig(config)
defineNgCorexConfig(config)
```

---

### `@ngcorex/cli`

Command-line interface.

Available commands:

```bash
ngcorex build
ngcorex build --watch
ngcorex build --dry-run
ngcorex version
```

---

## How ngCorex Works (High Level)

1. You write `ngcorex.config.ts`
2. CLI transpiles the config using **esbuild**
3. Config is loaded from a temporary `.mjs` file
4. Engine:

   * normalizes tokens
   * applies constraints
   * generates CSS variables
5. CSS is written to the output file

All of this happens **before your app runs**.

---

## Config Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

Your `ngcorex.config.ts` **must only import from npm packages**.

### ✅ Correct

```ts
import { defineNgCorexConfig } from '@ngcorex/css';
```

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
import { defineNgCorexConfig } from './packages/css/dist';
```

Why?

* Config is transpiled and loaded dynamically
* Relative imports break in this environment
* This rule is **strictly enforced**

---

## Requirements

Make sure you have **all of the following installed**:

### 1. Node.js

* Version: **22.x**
* Check with:

```bash
node -v
```

### 2. npm

Comes with Node.

Check with:

```bash
npm -v
```

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ngcorex.git
cd ngcorex
```

> Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

---

## Install Dependencies

From the **repo root**, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for:

* root
* `@ngcorex/css`
* `@ngcorex/cli`

---

## Build the Packages

### 1. Build the CSS engine

```bash
cd packages/css
npm run build
```

You should see:

* TypeScript compilation succeed
* `dist/` folder generated (but ignored by git)

---

### 2. Build the CLI

```bash
cd ../cli
npm run build
```

This produces the CLI executable in `dist/`.

---

### 3. Go back to root

```bash
cd ../..
```

---

## Test the CLI Locally

### Link the CLI globally (temporary)

```bash
npm link ./packages/cli
```

Now test:

```bash
ngcorex version
```

You should see the CLI version printed.

---

## Run a Build

From the repo root:

```bash
ngcorex build
```

What happens:

* `ngcorex.config.ts` is loaded
* Tokens are validated
* Constraints are applied
* CSS is generated and written to output

---

## Watch Mode

```bash
ngcorex build --watch
```

* Watches `ngcorex.config.ts`
* Rebuilds on change
* Errors do **not** crash the process

---

## Dry Run Mode

```bash
ngcorex build --dry-run
```

* Runs the full pipeline
* **Does not write files**
* Useful for debugging configs

---

## Constraint System (Current)

### Implemented Constraints

#### Spacing

* Auto-px fallback
* Configurable severity:

  * `error`
  * `warning`
  * `off`

#### Colors

* Validates:

  * `hex`
  * `rgb`
  * `rgba`
* Shade keys must be **numeric**
* No enforced semantic ordering (by design)

---

## Publishing (Dry Run)

Before publishing, always test:

```bash
npm publish --dry-run
```

Run this inside each package:

```bash
cd packages/css
npm publish --dry-run

cd ../cli
npm publish --dry-run
```

This verifies:

* package.json correctness
* files included
* entry points resolve

---

## Design Philosophy

* Incremental development
* Clarity over cleverness
* Explicit configuration
* Build-time guarantees
* Angular-first thinking

No Angular integration is planned **until the core engine is stable**.

---

## Status

* ✅ Engine works
* ✅ CLI works
* ✅ Watch mode works
* ✅ Constraints implemented
* 🧪 npm install / publish flow under validation
* 🚧 Angular integration planned later
